# EC544-SmartDoorBell-Final-Project

In this project, we plan to build a smart door system that makes the user enter his home easier and make the door more secure. The door system uses real-time face recognition to open the door for the host. Meanwhile, by pressing one button, it listens to the user’s voice input and conducts certain actions such as informing the host or opening the door. 

Specifically, it will have following functions: 
- Real-time face recognition: Recognize the incoming person’s identity by face recognition. Open the door if the person is the host.
- One-click start: After the user presses the door’s voice button, it will start listening to the user’s voice input.
- Voice control: Convert user’s voice into text and conduct certain actions. The door system will pre-install several actions map to the corresponding user's voice input. If matched over like 85%, conduct the actions. Actions such as open/close the door, inform the host could be done over voice control.
- Sentiment analysis: Depending on the user's voice input, we obtain the sentiment score to decide to open the door or not. Aim to prevent robbery.
- Guardian: If an unknown person stays in front of the door over 30 seconds, be alert and inform the host.
